## Armenia vs Azerbaijan vs Turkey. Who's the Agressor?

On September 27, 2020, Azerbaijan attacked civilian populations of Armenia and [Artsakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh).<br/>
Recep Erdoğan of Turkey reacted by calling "[Armenia the biggest threat to peace in the region](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkey/erdogan-says-armenia-biggest-threat-to-regional-peace/1987364)".<br/>
Please, look at the numbers below and decide for yourself.

Armenia looks friendlier in every single aspect. The lack of support for Armenia is increasingly disappointing. A century ago, the Ottoman Empire committed the [genocide of Armenian, Greek and other Christian minorities in Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide). Until now, many countries [haven't recognized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide_recognition) those war crimes, even though it's an absolute historical fact.

By now, Turks have occupied [Northern Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus), [expanded their naval presence in the Mediterranean](https://www.dw.com/en/turkey-threatens-greece-over-disputed-mediterranean-territorial-claims/a-54828554) and attacked civilian populations in Artsakh. The only reason Artsakh even wants independence from Azerbaijan - is to **[avoid religious prosecution, like in the 1990s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku_pogrom)**. What's the point of UN, NATO and other peacekeeping organizations if they can't even publicly express support for the apparent victims?

I deliberately avoided this topic in 2020. It was a challenging year for many of us, but today's retaliation by Azeris didn't leave me a choice. I am in Yerevan, Armenia myself. I don't plan to leave, but don't want to join the army either. I am proud to have intelligent Azeri friends who have nothing to do with Alievs political agenda, let's help others see the full picture.

Your Armenian friend,<br/>
