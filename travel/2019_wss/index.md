I was submitted into Wolfram Summer School 2019 and it was an amazing experience. 

### What's the Wolfram Summer School?

Around 60 curious minds from all over the planet gather together for three weeks to work on random problems! Students, scientists, researchers and even entrepreneurs! Ages 15 to 70, I guess.
<br/>
Each person has an individual project and topics range from fundamental mathematics and theoretical physics to machine learning and blockchain! The only shared factor is the Wolfram Language and the ecosystem around it.

### How did it feel?

The majority of people had a physics background, so it felt like home! We would often discuss recent advances in science, and I would often feel rusty - being unable to remember the theorems I learned a few years ago!
<br/>
We were studying in the suburbs of Boston at Bentley University. Half an hour in a taxi and you are in the city centre, surrounded by friends, bars & restaurants, casinos and stations! Needless to say, I filled my free time with meetings, parties and poker tournaments!
<br/>
Most people came from outside the US, so we had a fantastic mixture of cultures, and everybody was sharing parts of their own! The list of countries I want to visit grew longer, as did my reading list!

### What I was working on?

I have built a software prototype intended to inspire **computational thinking in the domain of urban design**. The entire computational notebook can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ashvardanian/WolframSummer19).
