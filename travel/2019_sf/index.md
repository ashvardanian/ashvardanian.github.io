I have already left San Francisco (SF) and I'm ready to debunk some of the myths surrounding that place!
<br/>
🤑 High Salaries. Partly True. The absolute numbers are impressive, but the cost of fo living is also huge.
<br/>
🌆 High standard of living. Wrong. It's just to dirty. Not all neighbourhoods are the same, but the city centre is intolerable.
<br/>
🌁 Warm climate. Maybe in San Jose, but not in SF.
<br/>
🤖 Best tech talents. Exaggeration. Boston and Moscow are probably stronger.
<br/>
💵 Access to Funding. Partly true. There is a decent amount of cash accumulated by the venture firms in SF, but you have to compete with thousands of startups. China has more to offer.
<br/>
🤝 Best for Networking. True! In this case, San Francisco is untouchable. On average you have a couple of dozens of publicly available free tech meetups every week! You will meet people both from the research community and enterprise. In case you are running a B2B company, those connections can be crucial for your business!
<br/>
In general, it's a very unique place! I have enjoyed my stay and met great people! I am currently in Canada and will go back to Europe in a couple of months. See you there!
