5 weeks in Yerevan! For years I didn’t go there and only observed Armenia from the outside, but this trip had to happen!

### Why now? 

👑 After the revolution a year ago, the country is becoming less bureaucratic and more tech-friendly. In October Yerevan hosted a dozen of tech events including WCIT, GIF, HIVE and the Aurora Prize charity event. The city had just turned 2801 years old, but we were not discussing our past. We were focused on the future! I was happy to see scientists, developers and business people visiting my motherland for the first time and I hope they are coming back!

### What did I like?

🤓 Lots of educated people! People often speak 3 or more languages (🇦🇲, 🇷🇺, 🇬🇧). Chess is part of the school's curriculum on par with Maths and Physics. 
<br/>
😎 Hi-tech professions are prestigious! Sounds obvious to some, but in Russia, kids would instead prefer to be Oligarchs, while in the US they want to be Youtube/Instagram celebrities. New startups appear every day and the government supports them with tax exemption policies!
<br/>
✈️ Armenia is opening up to the world, and there is hope for visa-free entry programs with Europe and with China. If you are a Russian citizen you only need an ID card to enter the country. 
<br/>
🎒 Some of the best mid/high-schools for kids! Check out TUMO, Ayb and UWC Dilijan. They are equipped better than some labs, and it’s paying out! Education is the first thing to invest in!

### What don't I like?

🛂 Very homogeneous society. There are not many people immigrating to Armenia from the western world and the ones who come from Asia generally represent just a couple of countries. I would love to see more diversity! To make things worse, even the diaspora is often unaware of opportunities available in their home country. We need better PR!
<br/>
☭ Classical problems of post-soviet countries. Universities are poorly funded, and most talented kids leave the country in pursuit of higher education. The legal system is weak and requires lots of reforms. Low wages, struggling economy, etc. 
<br/>
What to do in Armenia as a tourist?
<br/>
🍷 Eat & drink! The local cuisine and the quality of ingredients will force you to come back! Try Lavash, Lamadzho, Hash soup, Spas soup and of course Dolma!
<br/>
🏺 Visit historical sights! It's located a little north of Mesopotamia and a little east of Byzantine. At different times it was part of Roman and Ottoman empires and once was an empire on its own - Urartu! Needless to say, there is plenty of structures tracing back to the first millennia. It was the first country to adopt Christianity, but you can still find pagan temples like Garni and many other ancient places!

### Conclusion

All in all, it's a very unique country, whose people have managed to preserve their peaceful culture and identity after centuries of repressions in the most militarized part of the globe! I am definitely coming back next year and so should you!
