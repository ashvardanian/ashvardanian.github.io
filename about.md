Hey, I'm Ashot!

I research Artificial Intelligence, design High-Performance Software and have been building [Unum](https://unum.xyz) since 2015!
Unum is in stealth-mode until now, but certain details will be uncovered until the end of 2020.

## Random Facts

🌍 Visited over 50 countries across 4 continents, lived in 11 of them.<br/>
👅 Fluent in Russian, Armenian & English. Intermediate in a few other languages. <br/>
🔭 Dropped my Astrophysics degree twice.<br/>
📚 First line of code: elementary school. Free-lancing: middle school. First profitable IT business: high school.<br/>
💻 These days I code in C++ 20, Python, Swift & LISPs.<br/>
💵 In my free time, I make investments, assemble servers and teach. <br/>

## Current Work

- __Unum Framework for Artificial Intelligence__, that scales beyond traditional limits. [Read more...](https://unum.xyz)
