title: Hey, I'm Ashot!
---

I am 25 yo and I do all kinds of stuff, but mostly:

* Artificial Intelligence, 
* High-Performance Computing and
* Risky Investment Stretegies.

## My Timeline

👶🏻 Wrote my first line of code in the elementary school.<br/>
👦🏻 Received my first freelance Web-Dev order in the middle school.<br/>
🧔🏻 Launched my first profitable IT business in the high school.<br/>
🔭 Dropped my Astrophysics degree. Twice.<br/>
🏢 Already spent 5 years building [Unum](https://unum.xyz) without external funding.<br/>
🌍 Visited over 50 countries across 4 continents, lived in 11 of them.<br/>
👅 Fluent in Russian, Armenian & English. Intermediate in a few other languages. <br/>
💻 These days I code in C++ 20, Python, Swift & LISPs.<br/>

## Current Work

- [Project Unum](https://unum.xyz), that aims to scale Artificial Intelligence beyond traditional limits.
- [C* Programming Language](https://unum.xyz/cstar), that unites the simplicity of Common LISP and the power of C++.
